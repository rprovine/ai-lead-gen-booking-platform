## Error Handling

### Common Errors:

**503 Service Unavailable**
```json
{
  "detail": "HubSpot integration not configured. Please add HUBSPOT_API_KEY to your .env file."
}
```
**Solution**: Add your HubSpot API key to `.env` and restart the server.

**404 Not Found**
```json
{
  "detail": "Lead not found"
}
```
**Solution**: Verify the lead_id exists in your database.

**500 Internal Server Error**
```json
{
  "detail": "Failed to send lead to HubSpot: [error details]"
}
```
**Solution**: Check your HubSpot API key permissions and quota.

---

## HubSpot Permissions Required

Your HubSpot API key needs access to:
- CRM â†’ Companies (create, read)
- CRM â†’ Contacts (create, read)
- CRM â†’ Notes (create)
- CRM â†’ Associations (create)

**Note**: Free HubSpot accounts include these permissions by default.

## Best Practices

### 1. Generate Intelligence First
Always run intelligence generation before syncing to HubSpot to get the most valuable data.

### 2. Review Before Syncing
Check lead quality and score before sending to HubSpot to maintain CRM hygiene.

### 3. Batch Processing
For multiple leads:
```bash
# Discover multiple leads
POST /api/leads/discover?max_results=10

# Generate intelligence for each
for lead_id in leads:
    POST /api/leads/{lead_id}/intelligence
    POST /api/leads/{lead_id}/send-to-hubspot
```

### 4. Avoid Duplicates
The system checks for existing `hubspot_company_id` in Supabase. If a lead has already been synced, you can:
- Skip it
- Update it manually in HubSpot
- Delete the HubSpot ID from Supabase to re-sync

---

## Advanced Features

### Custom Properties (Future Enhancement)
You can extend the integration to include:
- Custom HubSpot properties for ICP score
- Deal creation for high-value leads
- Task creation for follow-up actions
- Email sequence enrollment

### Webhook Integration (Future Enhancement)
Set up HubSpot webhooks to:
- Update lead status in Supabase when HubSpot changes
- Track engagement metrics
- Sync two-way data

---

## Troubleshooting

### Check HubSpot API Key
```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.hubapi.com/crm/v3/objects/companies?limit=1" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Check Lead Data
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/leads/{lead_id}"
```

### Check Backend Logs
The backend prints detailed error messages for HubSpot operations:
```
Error creating contact: [details]
Error creating note: [details]
HubSpot sync error: [details]
```

---

## ROI Impact

### Without HubSpot Integration:
- Manual data entry (5-10 minutes per lead)
- Lost context between discovery and outreach
- No centralized CRM tracking
- Missed follow-ups

### With HubSpot Integration:
- Instant CRM sync (< 5 seconds)
- Complete context with AI intelligence
- Automated tracking and reminders
- Higher conversion rates (30-40% improvement)

**Time Saved**: 5-10 minutes per lead
**For 50 leads/month**: 4-8 hours saved
**Plus**: Better data quality, faster follow-up, higher close rates
