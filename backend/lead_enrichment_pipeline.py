Lead Enrichment Pipeline - Automated Contact & Intelligence Enrichment

Runs after lead discovery to:
1. Find decision-maker contacts (emails, phones, LinkedIn)
2. Run AI research (Perplexity + Claude)
3. Generate personalized sales playbooks
4. Prepare leads for HubSpot with complete intelligence

This happens BEFORE leads go to HubSpot, so they're ready to engage.
